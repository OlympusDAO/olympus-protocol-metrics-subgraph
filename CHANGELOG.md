# Subgraph Changelog

## 4.6.0 (2023-03-25)

- Include the OHM requivalent of gOHM and sOHM in protocol- and DAO-owned wallets when calculating supply metrics.
- Remove the Olympus Association wallet from being included in supply metrics, as it is not protocol- or DAO-owned.
- The above two changes apply to metric values calculated after `GOHM_INDEXING_BLOCK`, to maintain auditability of historical data and reports.

## 4.5.1 (2023-03-24)

- Removes OHM (and variants) in the DAO working capital address from being listed as in the treasury

## 4.5.0 (2023-03-19)

- Adds the DAO working capital multi-sig to indexed and circulating supply wallets

## 4.4.4 (2023-03-17)

- Add additional deployment of OHM to Silo
- Support for OHM minted for Boosted Liquidity Vaults

## 4.3.1 (2023-03-29)

- The names of staked/locked/earned tokens are differentiated from raw tokens, to avoid clobbering. #194

## 4.1.0 (2023-03-16)

- Add the ability to define a multiplier used in calculating liquid backing. This is used for tokens where the protocol
owns a significant percentage of the token's total supply, and exchanging the token would incur considerable slippage. Currently, these are: BOND, KLIMA, JONES, rlBTRFLY, VSTA.

## 4.0.2 (2023-03-13)

- Shift from whitelisting assets in the DAO wallet to a blacklist (since many assets are held there now)

## 3.9.11 (2023-03-11)

- Utilise Chainlink price feeds for USDC and DAI, instead of assuming = $1
- Utilise Chainlink price feed for ETH
- Shifts price resolution for stable-ish assets away from a hard-coded value (still WIP)

## 3.8.18 (2023-03-10)

- Fix locked/unlocked balances with rlBTRFLY

## 3.8.17 (2023-03-07)

- Add Olympus Association wallet to the circulating supply wallets
- Add support for revenue-locked BTRFLY (rlBTRFLY), which is excluded from liquid backing due to high slippage
- Correct categorisation of Curve FraxBP
- Add missing proxy contract for staked OHM-FraxBP
- Add token lookup for wstETH
- Add POL entry for OHM-wstETH pool in Balancer (including the Balancer gauge and Aura vault)

## 3.7.14 (2023-03-03)

- Minor code change to force re-indexing

## 3.7.13 (2023-02-21)

## 3.3.11 (2023-01-30)

- Remove price-snapshot from protocol-metrics, as it now has its own subgraph

## 3.2.15 (2023-01-23)
